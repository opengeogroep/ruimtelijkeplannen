Adding styles
=============

Each folder in this directory contains a style which can be selected in the settings dialog of the plugin.

Create a style by copying one of the folders and adapt the style files in the new folder. 
The style will become available for selecting in the settings dialog immedeately. No plugin reload required.

If a style file is missing in one of the styles folder, QGIS will issue a warning and use a random style.

Sharing styles
==============

If you've created a nice style which is useful to others please share by creating a pull request on [github](https://github.com/opengeogroep/ruimtelijkeplannen). You can also create an issue there or mail the style as a zip file to the maintainer of the github repository.
